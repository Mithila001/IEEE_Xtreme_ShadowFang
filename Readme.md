## 1. Setup Environment

First, ensure you have created and are inside the project directory.

### 1.1. Activate Virtual Environment

You must **activate** the virtual environment (`.venv`) before installing dependencies.

**Windows PowerShell**

```bash

./.venv/Scripts/Activate.ps1

```

**Windows Command Prompt**

```bash

.\.venv\Scripts\activate.bat

```

## 2. Install Dependencies

Once the environment is active, install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
